=======

Crunch is part of a complete breakfast.

Installing Crunch
--------------

1. Install Adobe AIR! - http://get.adobe.com/air/
2. Grab the latest release here: https://github.com/matthew-dean/Crunch/releases.

Loving Crunch
-------------
Go to http://crunchapp.net/ and express your love for Crunch by clicking on the "Buy Us A Coffee" link and donating. Everyone who is awesome does this. Donations do things like pay for web hosting and buy us coffees. (Donations never buy us tea because that would be lying.)

Who Made Crunch?
--------------
Crunch was made by two Matts (although Matt did most the work). A number of other people have since volunteered time to help make Crunch awesome, including:

* Michael
* Andrew
* Mark
* Nir
* Brandon

What's Next For Crunch?
